                        <h5 class="red-text underlined">Our goal</h5>
                    <p>
                        AESCRA aims to contribute to the reduction of social or cultural inequalities and the achievement of equality between men and women by ensuring that all those who are willing and able to do so have access to the development of their professional skills.
